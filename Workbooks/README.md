# Workbooks for the fast.ai course: [Practical Deep Learning for Coders] (https://course.fast.ai/)
This folder contains Jupyter notebooks from this [repository](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook). 
I have copied these notebooks to edit, run, and use as a learning aid while I go through the course.
